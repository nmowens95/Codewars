# Title: Transportation on vacation

# Instructions:
'''
After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).
'''

# Answer:

def rental_car_cost(days):
    if days < 3:
        return days * 40
    elif 7 > days >= 3:
        return (days * 40) - 20
    else:
        return (days * 40) - 50
