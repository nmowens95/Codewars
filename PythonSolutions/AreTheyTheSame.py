# Title: Are They the "Same"

# Instructions:
'''
Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.

Examples
Valid arrays
a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  
b = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
comp(a, b) returns true because in b 121 is the square of 11, 14641 is the square of 121, 20736 the square of 144, 361 the square of 19, 25921 the square of 161, and so on. It gets obvious if we write b's elements in terms of squares:

a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11] 
b = [11*11, 121*121, 144*144, 19*19, 161*161, 19*19, 144*144, 19*19]
Invalid arrays
If, for example, we change the first number to something else, comp is not returning true anymore:

a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  
b = [132, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
comp(a,b) returns false because in b 132 is not the square of any number of a.

a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]  
b = [121, 14641, 20736, 36100, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
comp(a,b) returns false because in b 36100 is not the square of any number of a.

Remarks
a or b might be [] or {} (all languages except R, Shell).
a or b might be nil or null or None or nothing (except in C++, COBOL, Crystal, D, Dart, Elixir, Fortran, F#, Haskell, Nim, OCaml, Pascal, Perl, PowerShell, Prolog, PureScript, R, Racket, Rust, Shell, Swift).
If a or b are nil (or null or None, depending on the language), the problem doesn't make sense so return false.

Note for C
The two arrays have the same size (> 0) given as parameter in function comp.

# Answer:

def comp(array1, array2):
    # Check if either array is None
    if array1 is None or array2 is None:
        return False

    # Check if the lengths of the arrays are not equal
    if len(array1) != len(array2):
        return False

    # Create a dictionary to store the count of squares of elements from array1
    count_dict = {}

    # Count the squares of elements in array1 and store them in count_dict
    for num in array1:
        square = num * num
        if square in count_dict:
            count_dict[square] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[square] = 1

    # Check if each square of elements in array2 exists in count_dict
    # and has the same multiplicity
    for num in array2:
        if num not in count_dict or count_dict[num] == 0:
            return False
        count_dict[num] -= 1

    return True
